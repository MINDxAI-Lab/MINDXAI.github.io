          Dr. Yunmei Liu is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering at the University of Louisville,
          where she also holds the position of Theme Director for Human-Centric AI at the Center for Human Systems Engineering (CHSE).
          In addition, Dr. Liu is affiliated with the Louisville Automation & Robotics Research Institute (LARRI),
          further emphasizing her engagement in cutting-edge research in automation and robotics. Dr. Liu received her Ph.D.
          degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering, with a minor in Statistics, from University of Florida (UF) in December 2023,
          following her M.S. degree from Nanjing University in 2019 and her B.S. degree from Shandong University in 2016. Her research
          focuses on developing Human-Centric AI by using wearable sensors to collect and analyze physiological and performance
          data, enabling AI systems to adapt to human needs and limitations. During her Ph.D., Dr. Liu was recognized with several
          honors, including the UF College of Engineering's Certificate for Outstanding Achievement, the Harold D. Haldeman,
          Jr. Graduate Fellowship, and the Linda Parker Hudson Fellowship from UF's Industrial and Systems Engineering Department.
